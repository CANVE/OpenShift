Template Cartridge for Scala Projects (for OpenShift)

This repo is based off the OpenShift `diy` cartridge, the tedious documentation for which is at
http://openshift.github.io/documentation/oo_cartridge_guide.html#diy, and https://github.com/jm2dev/openshift-demo-with-spray to which I am very grateful.

# How to use this template:

### To deploy to OpenShift:

TBD (deploy like any other custom cartridge)

### To reuse this template for other projects:

+ As in this repo, your sbt project should be placed under `/payload`
